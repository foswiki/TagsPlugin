     | =query="tag"= <br /> =query="topic"= <br /> =query="user"= | This defines the primary dimension for your search. Every search has three dimensions: =tag=, =topic= and =user=. | ="tag"= |
     | =tag="text"= <br /> =tag="all"= | Filter the =tag= dimension with this setting. Use =%= as a wildcard. | ="all"= |
     | =user="wikiname"= <br /> =user="all"= | Filter the =user= dimension with this setting. Leave out the =%MAINWEB%= part here. | ="all"= |
     | =web="Name"= <br /> =web="%USERSWEB%, Know"= <br /> =web="all"= | Comma-separated list of webs to search. The special word =all= means all webs (inlcuding those which have the =NOSEARCHALL= preference set to =on=). Use =%= as a wildcard. | ="all"= |
     | =topic="Name"= <br /> =topic="<nop>TestTopic1, <nop>TestTopic2"= <br /> =topic="all"= | Comma-separated list of topics (without a webname) to search. The special word =all= means all topics. Use =%= as a wildcard. | ="all"= |
     | =public="all"= <br /> =public="public"= <br /> =topic="private"= | Filter by the public flag: either show all, only public or only private tags. | ="all"= |
     | =header="..."= <br /> =format="..."= <br /> =footer="..."= | Custom format results: see table below for allowed variables. | depending on the =query= parameter, a simple list |
     | =separator=", "= <br /> =sep=", "= | Separator _between_ search hits | =", "= |
     | =order="tag"= <br /> =order="topic"= <br /> =order="user"= | This affects the sorting. | =none= |
   * If two hits only differ in (tag|topic|user) and the =format= does not contain a (tag|topic|user) variable, the (two) hits clash into a single hit.
